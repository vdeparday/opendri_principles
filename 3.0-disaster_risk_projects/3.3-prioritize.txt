## 8. Prioritize Open Source
Where possible, open data projects should also seek to leverage open source software. A common misperception about open source is that itsprimary benefit is the lack of licensing fees. In practice, the main advantages tend to result more from participation in active and collaborative communities that grow up around open source software andcreate expertise within the government, private and academic sectors with the ability to customize and extend software to suit specific use cases. Without licensing and cost constraints, it is also easier for contributors to just start trying and iterate towards more complex use cases as well as to spend more resources on capacity building.When investing in software development or purchase, it makes sense to first investigate whether a comparable open source exists and the activity levels of its developer and user communities. Open source software development should take place on public software repositories such as Github and be well documented.
///Example: InaSafe///
The InaSafe platform is an open source tool that is used to develop scenario-based impact assessments. The software provides a user-friendly, rigorous way for decision-makers to understand and engage with risk information. The tool was developed through a long-term partnership between the Government of Indonesia, the Australia-Indonesia Facility for Disaster Reduction (AIFDR), the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery and the World Bank for use within the Indonesia Disaster Management Agency (BNPB). Because the tool is open source, it has since been customized for use in a number of other contexts including the Philippines and Malawi.
