### 7. Develop Strong Institutional Partnerships
Reducing climate and disaster risk and building resilience is a challenge that involves all of society. It's therefore desirable to treat the process of creating, managing, and using risk information the same. The design of a successful and sustainable open data project requires the development of strong networks of local partners. Potential partners include different branches of government, community groups, universities, and the private sector. Cultivating relationships between local partners can contribute to the sustainability of open data efforts and create possibility for new and unexpected activities beyond the time horizon of an individual project. In some countries, international programs such as the Open Government Partnership can also provide additional resources or legitimacy to a local open data project. Partnerships can help facilitate the transparent communication of activities, sharing of knowledge and results, and coordination that can reduce duplication of efforts across different sectors of society. Such practices help to build the necessary consensus for undertaking collective action related to reducing risk and preparing for and responding to disasters. 
///_Example: Sri Lanka OpenDRI Project///
OpenDRI has been working in Sri Lanka since April 2012 to increase access and meaningful use of risk information in the country. The core of the partnership has centered around the development of an online database, RiskInfo , which is based on the free and open-source tool GeoNode. Riskinfo is managed by the Disaster Management Center (DMC) and hosted on servers provided by the national IT ministry. It acts as a metadata catalog, data download portal, and map visualization platform for DRM data in the country.

Several national government agencies including the Disaster Management Center, the Survey Department and the Census Department have been involved from the beginning in the design and management of the project. Over the course of the project, other key national agency have been regularly consulted for inputs and updated on the progress and results of work. These partnerships have provided the initiative with a strong ownership within the DMC, an important credibility, and a legitimacy to interact with the local government. The national agencies also provide staff from the local offices to support the project and build their capacity through their involvement in the project.

Community mapping efforts in several parts of the country have also contributed to the development of new risk information, which is also made available through RiskInfo and has created opportunities to broaden the number of partners involved in the project, including universities, local community groups, and technology organizations. Over 60,000 buildings including location and structural characteristics have been mapped using the OpenStreetMap platform through this work. International coordination with groups such as the State Department's Humanitarian Information Unit (HIU) and the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap team helped to secure up-to-date imagery and quality assurance of the incoming data. OpenDRI Sri Lankaâ€™s success in developing partnerships across ministries, at various levels of government, and with non-governmental actors has helped to contribute to sustainable, broad-based, improvements in how risk information is managed and used in the country.
