Wherever possible, the creation of risk information should be a broadly inclusive process. Stakeholders from government, scientific and technical agencies that are intended users of the data should be included. The public, civil society organizations, and at-risk communities whose local knowledge is vital should also contribute to the information. This approach has been demonstrated successfully over decades of participatory GIS and community mapping activities. The OpenStreetMap platform in particular has been used to develop base maps and asset databases in support of risk modeling and contingency planning work. OSM, founded in 2004, Wikipedia of Maps etc.  The fields of Citizen Science and Participatory GIS provide rich underexplored, opportunities for further research and practice related to inclusive approaches to the creation of risk information.
///Example: Open Cities Kathmandu///
Between 2012 and 2014, the Open Cities project partnered with the Government of Nepal, local Universities, and local scientific organizations to support mapping of schools and health facilities in the Kathmandu Valley for use in seismic risk assessment. The project trained over 2,200 university students, government officials, or members of community organizations in basic surveying techniques and the use of the OpenStreetMap (OSM) platform and organized a series of mapping activities around Kathmandu. Throughout the project, participants surveyed 2,256 schools and 350 health facilities, creating a comprehensive map of the health and education infrastructure in the valley. The data was stored and made available to the public through OSM and a new organization, Kathmandu Living Labs (KLL) was created at the end of the project to continue supporting the growth of the Open Data community in Nepal. KLL and the local OSM community were very active in supporting the 2015 Nepal Earthquake response.
