### 1. Open by default
Those seeking to access closed disaster risk datasets will frequently encounter a variety of arguments, such as privacy or security concerns, as to why such data cannot be released to the public. Too often, however, these arguments are convenient excuses for maintaining the status quo. For example, the vast majority of data related to disaster risk has no bearing upon individual privacy or public security concerns.In other cases, government organizations are mandated to sell the data they create and maintain as part of cost-recovery meaures. In such situations, alternate funding models should be found that support such tasks without creating artificial barriers to widespread access to risk information.

Changing the existing license on a dataset can be far more challenging than ensuring that newly created data will be open. We should therefore adopt a strategy of 'open by default' in which data collected or produced during disaster risk management efforts is assumed to be open, unless there is a specific reason why its release would have negative impacts. Such an approach is less likely to encounter obstacles than efforts to change existing data management regimes. Plans should therefore be in place at the start of any project that will produce data to ensure that the data will be open at the end of the process. 
///Example: The World Bank Open Data Policy///
In 2010, the World Bank announced an Open Data Policy and made data contained in the World Development Indicators (WDI) openly available at the http://data.worldbank.org website. Since then, the World Bank has also made numerous other datasets, maps, reports freely accessible to the public. Most content is released under terms that permit reuse and distribution for both commercial and non-commercial purposes. Only in a few select cases, typically when the World Bank is not the primary owner of a dataset, are further restrictions imposed. The World Bank data policy is, therefore, open by default.
