### 4. Locally Owned
Wherever possible risk information should be managed at the scale that it describes. In other words, OpenDRI projects usually seek to work with local governments to manage city level data, national governments to take responsibility for country level data, and so forth. Other communities, including universities, civil society organizations, and technical agencies also have a stake in disaster and climate risk information and should be included. This ensures that the primary user base for this data is involved in its ongoing maintenance. Global data platforms run the risk of marginalizing potential users at national and subnational levels. Local management of risk data also contributes to building necessary capacity for its use and management. 
///Example: Malawi Spatial Data Working Group///
The Malawi Spatial Data Portal (MASDAP) was established in 2012 to address the issues of access to spatial data and to improve collaboration and use of the data by the Government of Malawi, the public and other key stakeholders. In order to set up, manage and maintain the technical platform and its data, a MASDAP working group was created comprising the key stakeholders involved in producing or using risk information. Originally, the working group was created around the Shire River Basin Management Program Technical Team and implementation agencies, the project it originally supported. Over time the working group extended to more general management of the platform at the national level, including institutions such as National Statistics Office, Surveys Department, Department of Climate Change and Meteorological Services, Agricultural Development Division, Department of Disaster Management, Water Resources, Universities of Malawi like The Polytechnic College and Chancellor College.

Examples of activities undertaken by the working group include: i) Regular meetings and shared communications ii) awareness campaigns to different stakeholders iii) Conduct trainings and capacity building on the usage of MASDAP platform and other related tools iv) provide feedback to improve the functionality of MASDAP platform v) develop a policy framework for sharing geospatial and other required data among all stakeholders, define minimum metadata and data quality vi) ensure baseline data required for post disaster assessments are collated and are available in ready and open to use format vii) the working group also coordinates and develops the strategy for the collection and use of the data gathered using community mapping techniques. In the southern region of Malawi, a sub-group of the national forum has been created to focus specifically on issues of data access and availability in their area.
