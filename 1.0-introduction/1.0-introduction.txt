The Open Data for Resilience Initiative (OpenDRI) was launched in 2011 to bring the policies and practices of the global open data movement to bear on the challenges of reducing vulnerability to natural hazards and the impacts of climate change. The OpenDRI project supports World Bank Disaster Risk Management Teams and our partners in governments, civil society, and international organizations to build local capacity and long-term ownership of open data projects that are tailored to meet specific needs and goals of their stakeholders.

OpenDRI projects work to improve processes surrounding the sharing, creation, and communication of risk data. 

To increase public access to risk information, OpenDRI engages in dialogue with governments on the value of open data through the creation of local working groups and pilot projects that evolve into long-term locally owned open data projects. OpenDRI provides technical solutions and assistance for the project implementation in the form of open data platforms. Such platforms allow for hosting, analyzing and managing data that is necessary for planning decision-making related to disaster risk. Partners can share geospatial data, combine those data into visualizations and exchange both the raw data and maps they produce. 

To engage communities in the creation of accurate and timely data about the rapidly evolving urban and rural environments in which they live, OpenDRI works with governments and local communities to utilize simple, collaborative, crowdsourcing mapping tools through community mapping. Community mapping projects mobilize the residents of a place to collect and maintain geospatial data about their built environment and its exposure to natural hazards, providing a dynamic source of infrastructure and risk information. Mapping projects also take build partnerships with development organizations and universities to support local efforts with remote mapping and crowdsourcing. 

To ensure that risk information is used effectively to assist decision-makers and the public in planning, preparedness and response activities, OpenDRI works with partners to engage in effective risk communication. Risk information needs to be fit-for-purpose and targeted towards the decision-makers who rely on it for guidance, yet communicating this information in clear and useful ways is challenging. OpenDRI supports the development and implementation of a number of tools and approaches to accomplish this.

This document describes the approach taken by the OpenDRI team to design and enact impactful and sustainable projects with our partner organizations and communities. It is organized into a series of nine principles, the first 5 of which guide our thinking about how risk information should be created, managed, and used. The final 4 principles shape our relationships with other actors involved in OpenDRI work. Following a short description of the principle, we also provide examples from past OpenDRI projects and suggestions for relevant resources.

If you have comments, suggestions, or an interest in partnering with OpenDRI on your project, please contact info@opendri.org so we can continue the conversation.

## OpenDRI Principles
### Disaster risk data should be:
1. .Open by default
2. .Accessible, Licensed, & Documented
3. .Co-created
4. .Locally Owned
5. .Communicated in ways that meet needs of the users

### Open Data projects should be designed to:
6. .Engage communities
7. .Build Strong Institutional Partnerships
8. .Prioritize Open Source
9. .Set clear, long-term goals
